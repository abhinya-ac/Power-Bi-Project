# FINANCIAL
The project involves the comprehensive financial analysis by product, customer segment, and geographic market of a firm's sales, COGS, and resulting profit margins. Power BI visualizes the analysis, with a particular focus on the identification of key trends, opportunities, and areas for improvement. The data includes sales performance by product, segment, and country to show how different parts of the business contribute to the overall health of the business.
##Key Highlights:
###Sales Performance:
The overall sales amount is at 73.35M. The highest contributors are from the product Paseo, which tops with sales of 21.3M.
Even though some products generated high sales, others have negative gross profits in some segments, such as Montana and Velo, indicating the possibility of inefficiency in some operations.
###Segments
The Government segment contributes a large chunk toward the revenues, followed by Small Business and Enterprise, which collectively accounted for 43% of the overall revenues at 31.54M.
Midmarket, with 1.99% of the total sales, is an opportunity for growth, which could be captured with focused strategies.
###Geographical Distribution:
The United States stands out as the top market with 16.56M, followed by France and Canada.
Regions like Mexico and Germany contribute less, therefore presenting opportunities for expanding market presence and increasing the effort of selling in those countries.
###COGS and Profitability:
The costs against their sales are very high for some products, reflecting negative gross profits, especially for categories like Channel Partners and Enterprise.
By either reducing COGS or strengthening the pricing strategy, overall profitability may be improved.
###Seasonal Trends:
The peaks of gross profit and sales start at roughly May and August, showing possible seasonality or strategic promotions. This may provide further leads for better optimization of inventories and promotion activities.
##Summary:
This project deeply analyzes the company's performance, focusing on main revenue drivers and key areas for cost improvement. The project underlines exceptionally good performance in the Government segment and US market but, at the same time, it reveals several underdeveloped segments and countries that present opportunities for further growth. Insights from this data are important in making strategic decisions that will bring about enhancements in profitability, refinement of operations, and new market opportunities.
